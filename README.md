The Project details in brief:

1. we created a homepage showing a four different categories of quotes.
2. we created a function textStyle in utils.dart to use i multiple Times to Style our fonts and quotes.
3. we created a quote page which opens dependng upon which category is selected and build a list view builder to show the quotes in list form and for instances added a hard quote.
4. we crated 2 list one for quotes and one for authors and we developed a web scrapper method to extract details or say quotes and auhors name from the  quote website.
5. we added that data extracted from website to the list view builder to show quotes in list form that we have created.
6. and finally we added some of the quotes on the home page as a decoration view.

******Thus with this we completed our project and uploaded on github to use it as an actual app in mobile.******
